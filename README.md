MovieDatabase.bak file for restoring full database of movies

Other three .sql files are queries that do as their names suggest

IMDB-Movie-Data.csv, file I found on another repository with all the relevant info I wanted for this database, used to create my database

Made this database as a short project to teach myself the basics of SQL, and as an easy way to filter
for movies by genre and rating in order to find movies to watch for myself and friends.
